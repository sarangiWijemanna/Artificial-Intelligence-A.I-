## COMPUTER VISION

### ✅ [DAY – 1 : Introduction to Computer Vision| How to Install Computer Vision Libraries](https://github.com/sarangiWijemanna/Artificial-Intelligence-A.I-/tree/main/Day%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Vision)

#### Definition 

Computer Vision involves the use of algorithms and techniques to enable computers to gain a deep understanding and extract relevant information from digital images or videos.

#### Installation

We used ```pip``` for installing the necessary libraries.

 - ```pip install imutils ```  for resize image / handle images or videos.
 - ```pip install opencv-python``` for real-time computer vision
 - ```pip install opencv-contrib-python```

##### Libraries

 - ```pip install pillow``` - PIL supports for opening, manipulating, saving different image fie format. Also, supports high quality images than open-cv (eg: satellite images).  
 - ```pip install  scikit-image``` - includes algorithms to deal with segmentation, filtering, feature detection etc.
 - SciPy
 - Numpy
 - Mahotas
 - Matplotlib
 - Wheel

#### Applications 

Object Recognition, Face Recognition, Autonomous Vehicle, Disease Detection, Emotion Recognition, Agriculture, Satellite Image Analysis, Mobile & Camera, OCR, Cryptography
